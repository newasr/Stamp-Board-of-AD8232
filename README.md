# AD8232 Stamp Board - PCB Design  

This repository contains the **KiCad v9** design files for a **compact AD8232 stamp board**, built according to **Figure 66** of the [AD8232 datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad8232.pdf).  

## Project Overview  
The **AD8232** is an integrated signal conditioning block designed for **ECG and biopotential measurement** applications. This project involves designing a **compact and manufacturable PCB** with the following key features:  

- **Compact Form Factor** – Optimized layout for minimal space usage  
- **Standardized Terminals** – VDD, GND, LO+, LO-, OUT, nSDN, LA, RA, RL  
- **Proper Grounding** – Copper pours on top and bottom layers for improved signal integrity  
- **Manufacturing-Ready** – Includes **Gerber files, BOM, and 3D visualization**  

## Files Included  
- **Schematic** – Circuit design of the AD8232 stamp board  
- **PCB Layout** – Optimized component placement and routing  
- **PCB Routing** – Defined traces and copper pours for signal integrity  
- **Gerber Files** – Ready for PCB fabrication  
- **Bill of Materials (BOM)** – Includes Digikey part numbers and component details  
- **3D Visualization** – Ensures proper component placement and alignment  

## Tools Used  
This project was developed using **KiCad v9**, an open-source EDA tool.  

### Custom Libraries  
- **myLibrary.kicad_sym** – Custom schematic symbols  
- **myLibrary.pretty** – Custom footprints and 3D models  

### Component Footprints  
- All **resistors, capacitors, inductors, and LEDs** use:  
  **0402_1005Metric**
