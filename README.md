# **AD8232 Stamp Board - PCB Design**  

This repository contains the **KiCad v9** design files for a **compact AD8232 stamp board**, built according to **Figure 66** of the [AD8232 datasheet](https://www.analog.com/media/en/technical-documentation/data-sheets/ad8232.pdf).  

## **Project Overview**  
The **AD8232** is an integrated signal conditioning block designed for **ECG and biopotential measurement** applications. This project involves designing a **compact and manufacturable PCB** with the following key features:  

✅ **Compact Form Factor** – Optimized layout for minimal space usage  
✅ **Standardized Terminals** – VDD, GND, LO+, LO-, OUT, nSDN, LA, RA, RL  
✅ **Proper Grounding** – Copper pours on top and bottom layers for improved signal integrity  
✅ **Manufacturing-Ready** – Includes **Gerber files, BOM, and 3D visualization**  

## **Files Included**  
- **📜 Schematic** – Circuit design of the AD8232 stamp board  
- **📏 PCB Layout** – Optimized component placement and routing  
- **📡 PCB Routing** – Defined traces and copper pours for signal integrity  
- **📁 Gerber Files** – Ready for PCB fabrication  
- **📄 Bill of Materials (BOM)** – Includes Digikey part numbers and component details  
- **🖥️ 3D Visualization** – Ensures proper component placement and alignment  

## **Tools Used**  
This project was developed using **KiCad v9**, an open-source EDA tool.  

### **Custom Libraries**  
- **`myLibrary.kicad_sym`** – Custom schematic symbols  
- **`myLibrary.pretty`** – Custom footprints and 3D models  

### **Component Footprints**  
- All **resistors, capacitors, inductors, and LEDs** use:  
  **0402_1005Metric_Pad0.72x0.64mm_HandSolder**
